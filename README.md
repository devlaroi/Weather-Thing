A **Python CLI application** that automatically detects your location and displays **current weather**, **5-day forecast**, and **air quality**, using the free **OpenWeatherMap** API.

The project’s goal is to provide detailed meteorological information directly in the terminal, in a simple and informative way.

## ▶️ How to Use

Run the script:

```bash
python weather.py
```

The program will:

1. Validate the API key
2. Automatically detect your location
3. Fetch current weather data
4. Display a detailed 5-day forecast
5. Show air quality information
